== Checkout V3

This action checks-out your repository unser `+$CLOUDBEES_WORKSPACE+`, so your workflow can access it.

Only a single commit is fetched by default, for the ref/SHA that triggered the workflow.
Set `+fetch-depth:0+` to fetch all history for all branches and tags.

The auth token is persisted in the local git config. This enabled your scripts to run authenticated git commands in container images that have git executables present.

    # Default: ${{ cloudbees.repository }}
    repository:

    # The branch, tag or SHA to checkout. When checking out the repository that
    # triggered a workflow, this defaults to the reference or SHA for that
    # event.  Otherwise, uses the default branch.
    ref: ''

    # Personal access token (PAT) used to fetch the repository. The PAT is configured
    # with the local git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated git
    # commands. The post-job step removes the PAT.
    #
    # We recommend using a service account with the least permissions necessary.
    # Also when generating a new PAT, select the least scopes necessary.

    # Whether to perform strict host key checking. When true, adds the options `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes`

    # Whether to checkout submodules: `true` to checkout submodules or `recursive` to
