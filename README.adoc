= CloudBees action: Check out a Git repository

Use this action to check out a Git repository under `+$CLOUDBEES_WORKSPACE+`, to allow your workflow to access the repository. 

Your authentication for the checked-out repository is persisted in the local Git config file by default, so your scripts can run authenticated Git commands in any container image that has Git executables.

The CloudBees API token is used to fetch an app access token if neither the PAT nor a SSH key are provided.

.Input details
|===

| Input name
| Data type
| Required?
| Description

| `bitbucket-server-url`
| String
| No
| The base URL for the Bitbucket instance to clone. The environment defaults, such as `BITBUCKET_SERVER_URL` are used to fetch the same instance running the workflow. Example URLs:  `https://bitbucket.org` or `https://my-bbdc-server.example.com`

| `clean`
| Boolean
| No
| Default is `true`. When `true`, executes `git clean -ffdx && git reset --hard HEAD` before fetching.

|`cloudbees-api-token`
| String
| No
| The CloudBees API Token to use when fetching SCM token when a `token` or `ssh-key` are not used. Default value is `${{ cloudbees.api.token }}`

|`cloudbees-api-url`
| String
| No
|The CloudBees API root URL to use when fetching SCM tokens. The default value is `${{ cloudbees.api.url }}`

| `fetch-depth`
| Number
| No
| Number of commits to fetch.
Default is `1`.
`0` indicates a full history for all branches and tags.

| `github-server-url`
| String
| No
| The base URL for the GitHub instance to clone. The environment defaults, such as `GITHUB_SERVER_URL` are used to fetch the same instance running the workflow. Example URLs:  `https://github.com` or `https://my-ghes-server.example.com`

| `gitlab-server-url`
| String
| No
| The base URL for the GitLab instance to clone. The environment defaults, such as `GITLAB_SERVER_URL` are used to fetch the same instance running the workflow. Example URLs:  `https://gitlab.com` or `https://my-gl-server.example.com`

| `lfs`
| Boolean
| No
| Default is `false`. When `true`, downloads Git-LFS files.

| `path`
| String
| No
| The relative repository path under the `$CLOUDBEES_WORKSPACE`.

| `persist-credentials`
| Boolean
| No
| Default is `true`. When `true`, the token or SSH key is configured with the local Git configuration.

| `provider`
| String
| No

|  The SCM provider hosting the repository. For example GitHub, BitBucket, GitLab or custom. The default is `${{ cloudbees.scm.provider }}`

| `ref`
| String
| No
| The branch, tag or SHA to check out.
The action uses the default branch, except when checking out the triggering workflow repository. In that instance, the event reference or SHA is used.

| `repository`
| String
| No
| The repository name with owner. For example, actions/checkout. For example, `actions/checkout`. If the provider is custom then the value is the repository URL  Default value is `${{ cloudbees.scm.repository }}`

| `set-safe-directory`
| Boolean
| No
| Default is `true`. When `true`, adds a repository path as `safe.directory` for the Git global config, by running `git config --global --add safe.directory <path>`.

| `ssh-key`
| String
| No
| SSH key used to fetch the repository.
The SSH key is configured with the local Git config, which enables scripts to run authenticated Git commands.

We recommend using a service account with minimal permissions.

| `ssh-known-hosts`
| String
| No
| The SSH keys for a host and the user and global host key database. Use the utility `ssh-keyscan` to get public SSH keys for a host.

The public keys for GitHub, Bitbucket, and GitLab are  implicitly added by default.

| `ssh-strict`
| Boolean
| No
| Default is `true`. When `true`, performs strict host key checking, by adding the options `StrictHostKeyChecking=yes` and `CheckHostIP=no` to the SSH command line.
Use the input `ssh-known-hosts` to configure additional hosts.

| `submodules`
| Boolean
| No
| Default is `false`. When `true`, checks out submodules.
Use the value `recursive`, to recursively check out submodules.
When the `ssh-key` input is not provided, SSH URLs beginning with `git@github.com:` are converted to HTTPS.

| `token`
| String
| No
| The PAT used to fetch the repository.
The PAT is configured with the local Git config, which enables your scripts to run authenticated Git commands.

| `token-auth-type`
| String
| No
| The authentication type of the token being used.
Supported values are `basic` and `bearer`.
Default is `basic`.

== Usage example

In the YAML file, all values are required, unless otherwise noted. Default values are included in the example YAML file below. Refer to the notes for options and details.

[NOTE]
====
CloudBees recommends:

* Use a service account that limits user access to only necessary permissions.
* When generating a new PAT, select the narrowest possible scope.
====

In your YAML file, add:

[source,yaml]
